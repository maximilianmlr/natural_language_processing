  <h1>Sentiment Analysis and Machine Learning Classification</h1>

This GitHub repository contains a Python script for sentiment analysis and machine learning classification of text data using various algorithms. The script leverages popular libraries such as pandas, nltk, matplotlib, numpy, textblob, re, sklearn, wordcloud, and more. It showcases a comprehensive workflow that includes data preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, evaluation, and analysis.

  <h2>Features</h2>
  <ul>
      <li>Data is sourced from multiple datasets (Yelp, Amazon, IMDB) and consolidated into a single dataframe for
          analysis.</li>
      <li>Text preprocessing techniques such as cleaning, tokenization, and stop-word removal are applied to prepare
          the data for analysis.</li>
      <li>Textual features are extracted using TF-IDF vectorization, enhancing the quality of input data for
          classification.</li>
      <li>Five different classification algorithms are employed:
          <ul>
              <li>Logistic Regression</li>
              <li>Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) Classifier</li>
              <li>Random Forest Classifier</li>
              <li>Support Vector Machine (SVM) Classifier</li>
              <li>Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) Classifier</li>
          </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Cross-validation is utilized to assess the models' performance and ensure robustness.</li>
      <li>The accuracy, recall, precision, and F1-score are reported for each algorithm, providing a comprehensive
          evaluation.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Usage</h2>
  <ol>
      <li>Open the code in a Python environment (e.g., Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab).</li>
      <li>Ensure the required libraries are installed.</li>
      <li>Run the code blocks sequentially to execute the entire workflow.</li>
      <li>Observe the accuracy and other metrics reported for each classification algorithm.</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Note</h2>
  <ul>
      <li>Make sure to have an active internet connection for accessing the data from URLs.</li>
      <li>The code can be extended and modified to accommodate other datasets and further analysis.</li>
  </ul>
